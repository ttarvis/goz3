## More documentation coming soon
as soon as code is completed

See [Godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ttarvis/goz3)

## Installation
### Requirements
* A Go compiler
* Z3
* This binding

## goz3
This is a binding in Go for the Z3 SMT Solver.  It uses the Z3 API.

## Z3
An SMT solver with various different types.

## Purpose
Other bindings exist, however, they could not be compiled or had not completed Z3 API coverage
so I have made a new one with much more coverage in a way that was simple and exposed very
intuitive types that neatly wrap Z3 types.

If you have an intended use for this software, let me know about it.

## Examples

see examples.  More will be uploaded shortly.

## Instructions

Compile, use as z3.
